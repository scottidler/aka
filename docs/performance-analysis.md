### Wall-Clock vs Internal Timing

The significant difference between wall-clock and internal timing reveals important insights:

| Component | Time | Percentage of Total |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Process Startup | ~66ms | 98.5% |
| Config Loading (Direct) | 1.77ms | 1.3% |
| IPC Communication (Daemon) | 0.39ms | 0.6% |
| Alias Processing | 0.37ms | 0.6% |

## Performance Insights

### Primary Bottleneck: Config Loading
- **Direct mode spends 99.9% of time loading configuration** (1.774ms)
- **Daemon eliminates this overhead** by pre-loading config
- **YAML parsing dominates** execution time in direct mode

### IPC Overhead is Minimal
- **Unix socket communication** adds only 0.390ms
- **Well-optimized protocol** with efficient serialization
- **Acceptable trade-off** compared to 1.774ms config loading cost

### Process Startup Dominates Wall-Clock Time
- **Binary loading and initialization** takes ~66ms
- **Rust runtime startup** contributes to overhead
- **Shell process spawning** adds additional cost

### Alias Processing is Consistent
- **Core logic performs consistently** at ~0.37ms regardless of mode
- **Efficient algorithm** with minimal variance
- **Not a performance bottleneck**

## Real-World Impact Analysis

### Performance Scaling by Usage Pattern

| Usage Pattern | Queries/sec | Daemon Advantage | Time Saved |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Interactive CLI | 1-2 | 77.2% | 1.37ms |
| ZLE Integration | 10-50 | 77.2% | 13.7-68.5ms |
| Batch Scripts | 100+ | 77.2% | 137ms+ |

### Usage Recommendations
